  - 'A century after its founding, Lexington Clinic was ready for a reintroduction. It’s home to neurosurgeons and pediatricians, physical therapists and oncologists — hundreds of providers in dozens of specialties. It’s not an urgent care clinic that shuffles you out the door with a flu test. It’s personalized care, just for you.'
