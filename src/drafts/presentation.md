Presentation decks are a part of life. Files that end in “final_revised_FIXED_v3.pdf” don’t have to be. I used [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build a Bullhorn presentation platform with responsive sizing, live updates, analytics, embedded videos, and version control.
