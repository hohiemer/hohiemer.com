I’m a copywriter and erstwhile front end developer currently working at <a href='https://mediocre.rodeo/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Mediocre↗</a> in Lexington, Kentucky. Before I was either of those things, I was a decent touring musician, a mediocre barista, and a pretty bad peach seller. Turns out, I'm allergic to peaches anyway.",
