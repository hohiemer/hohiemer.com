I’m a copywriter and front end developer currently working at <a href='https://bullhorncreative.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Bullhorn↗</a> in Lexington, Kentucky. Before I was either of those things, I was a decent touring musician, a mediocre barista, and a pretty bad peach seller. Turns out I'm allergic to peaches anyway.",
